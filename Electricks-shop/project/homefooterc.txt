            </div>

            <p class="indented1">The stick insect has been entertaining and educating school-age children in classrooms for years, because of its unique appearance and simple care needs. Now, more and more people are keeping stick insects as pets at home, according to science author Sandra Markle. These intriguing insects are usually 
                around 3 to 4 inches (7 to 10 centimeters) long and can live for several years in the right conditions.</p>

                    <h4><b>Is This Pet Right for You?</b></h4>
                </div>
                <p class="b">Stick insects are very low-maintenance and 
                    generally make good first pets for children, as long as adults are in charge of cleaning and
                     handling duties. Special care should be taken when handling the insects, as their limbs can break easily.
                      The species' unique appearance and 
                    interesting molting process make them a living science project for anyone's home.

                </div>
                <p class="bla1">Stick insects need tall enclosures, at least double the height of the insect, 
                    because they like to hang. They are omnivores and thrive on a diet of bramble, ivy or even lettuce. 
                    These insects don't like being alone and need other stick insects for companionship. 
                    Their enclosures should be kept at room temperature and cleaned out weekly. 
                    Stick insects molt many times before they reach maturity and need 
                    enough room to literally climb out of their skin.

            <h2> <b> 2.Capybara</b>  </h2>
        </div>
            
        
           <p class="indented">Capybaras are affectionately called giant rodents and giant guinea pigs but they 
               are not as simple to care for as their smaller cousins. 
               Capybaras can be found in households as pets, usually in groups,
                but are not legal to own everywhere.
                Related to the guinea pig, this native South American is the largest rodent in the world. 
                Fully grown, the capybara is on average 4 feet (1.2 meters) long and usually weighs more than 100 pounds (45 kilograms). It's rare to find these obscure animals as pets, but there's one capybara named Caplin Rous who's gained a loyal Internet following. His owner, Melanie Typaldos, who lives in Buda, 
                Texas, has made it her mission to educate people about this very unusual rodent.

            <div class="bla">
                <h4><b>Is This Pet Right for You?</b></h4>
            </div>
            <p class="bla">Capybaras need a lot of attention, 
                plenty of room to roam and some type of swimming pool. They can be territorial and could bite with their large teeth. Typaldos doesn't recommend capybaras for families with young children, because the rodents aren't nearly as tolerant as some other domestic pets, like dogs. Like most of the animals on our countdown, your city or state may have exotic pet legislation that 
                would keep you from owning a capybara, so always check the laws before bringing one home.</p>

                <h4><b>Caring for This Pet</b></h4>
            </div>
            <p class="bla1">Typaldos says capybaras are never fully domesticated, so you must handle one often while it's young to establish a human-rodent relationship. Capybaras need lots of outdoor space and places to swim, since they are semi-aquatic creatures. They eat a steady diet of grass and require fresh drinking water at all times.

                                <p class="indented1">Many think the surge in pet hedgehogs began with the release of the popular video game, "Sonic the Hedgehog" in 1991, and this is one fad that seems to have staying power. Hedgehogs are commonly mistaken for small porcupines, but the two species are not related. Hedgehogs can vary in size from .5 pounds to 1.5 pounds (.23 kilograms to .6 kilograms), 
                                    with spines up to .75 inches (1.9 centimeters) in length.

                                </div>
                                <p class="b">It is illegal to own a hedgehog in some states, and in Washington D.C. and New York City, so check your city's and state's laws before purchasing one. You should also make sure you can locate a vet in your area that will treat hedgehogs. A hedgehog can make a good pet if you're committed to weekly weight checks to ensure it's not eating too much or too little, and plenty of one-on-one time. 
                                    This is a pet that mostly sleeps all day and is up all night, so you'll also need to plan bonding time during odd hours.</p>

                                    <p class="bla1">Hedgehogs are generally low-maintenance, gentle pets. 
                                        Wild hedgehogs eat insects, but you can buy hedgehog mixes at pet stores that 
                                        are specially formulated for these spiny creatures and supplement their diet with insects, like crickets, as treats. They need to be handled often while they are young to adjust to humans. For living conditions, The Hedgehog Welfare Society (HWS) recommends cages no smaller than 30 by 24 inches (76 by 60 centimeters) 
                                        and at least 15 inches (38 centimeters) tall to accommodate exercise wheels.</p>

                                                <p class="indented1">Goats have long been kept as pets; even Abraham Lincoln had a pet goat in the White House during his presidency. Although most people don't keep standard dairy goats as pets anymore, pygmy goats are popular as pets, thanks to their compact sizes and friendly dispositions.
                                                     These grass-eaters are similar to small dogs in size and are generally considered easy to care for.</p>

                                                         The NPGA says that pygmies will react to their owners' voices, but even with a responsive goat,

                                                    <p class="bla1">Pygmy goats aren't as high maintenance as standard goats, but they still require 
                                                        shelters that are at least 8 by 10 feet (2.4 by 3 meters) with 4-foot (1.2 meters) high fencing, suggests the 
                                                        National Pygmy Goat Association (NPGA). They are very sociable and are happier in a herd atmosphere or with other 
                                                        pygmies to befriend. A balanced diet for these creatures includes grass hay, brush and leaves. 
                                                        While most livestock vets will treat pygmy goats, you should locate one before bringing home your unique pet.
