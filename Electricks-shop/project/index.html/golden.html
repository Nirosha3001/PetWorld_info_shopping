        <p><b>The Golden Retriever</b> is a medium-large gun dog that retrieves shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland
          game birds, during hunting and shooting parties. The name "retriever" refers to the breed's ability to
          retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth. Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and
          are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner
          coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their
          bodies and repels water. Golden retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments.
          They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming. The Golden
          Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.</p>

        <p>The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular
          as a disability assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In
          addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The
          breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its
          temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,
          the fifth-most popular in Brazil and Australia,and the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom. Golden
          Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample (two or more hours a day) exercise.The breed is fond of
          play but also highly trainable. </p>

          <p>As indicated by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is
            water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds in small amounts throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and
            keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds in the spring and fall. It usually lies flat
            against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in
            the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their
            fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of
            their tails.</p>
          <img src="../Ges (2).jpeg" style="width:60%" "height=40%" align="right">
          <p>The American Kennel Club (AKC) standard states the coat is a "rich, lustrous golden of various shades",
            disallowing extremely light or extremely dark coats.This leaves the outer ranges of coat colour up to a
            judge's discretion when competing in conformation shows. Therefore, "pure white" and "red" are unacceptable,
            as is black.The Kennel Club (UK) also permits cream as an acceptable coat colour.Judges may also disallow
            Goldens with pink noses, or those lacking pigment. The Golden's coat can also be mahogany, referred to as
            "redhead", although this is not accepted in the British show ring. As a Golden grows older, its coat can
            become darker or lighter, along with a noticeable whitening of the fur on and around the muzzle. Puppy coats
            are usually much lighter than their adult coats, but a puppy with darker ear tips may indicate a darker
            adult colour.</p>

          <center> <img src="../photo1.jpg" style="width:50%" "height=70%"></center>
          <p>The temperament of the Golden Retriever is a hallmark of the breed, and is described in the standard as
            "kindly, friendly and confident".Golden Retrievers make good family pets, particularly as they are patient
            with children.They are not "one-man dogs" and are generally equally amiable with both strangers and those
            familiar to them.Their trusting, gentle disposition makes them a poor guard dog. Any form of unprovoked
            aggression or hostility towards either people, dogs or other animals, whether in the show ring or community,
            is considered unacceptable in a Golden Retriever and is not in keeping with the character of the breed, nor
            should a Golden Retriever be unduly timid or nervous. The typical Golden Retriever is calm, naturally
            intelligent and biddable, and with an exceptional eagerness to please. </p>
          <p>Golden Retrievers are also noted for their intelligence. The breed ranks fourth in Stanley Coren's The
            Intelligence of Dogs – following the Border Collie, Poodle, and German Shepherd – as one of the brightest
            dogs ranked by obedience-command trainability. </p>
          <p>Typical Golden Retrievers are active and fun-loving animals with the exceptionally patient demeanour
            befitting a dog bred to sit quietly for hours in a hunting blind. Adult Goldens love to work, and have a
            keen ability to focus on a given task. They will work until they collapse, so care should be taken to avoid
            overworking them. <br>
            <img src="../ges (4).jpeg" style="width:30%" "height=45%" align="left">
            Other characteristics related to their hunting heritage are a size suited for scrambling in and out of boats
            and an inordinate love for water. Golden Retrievers are exceptionally trainable—due to their intelligence,
            athleticism and desire to please their handlers—and excel in obedience trials. They are also very
            competitive in agility and other performance events. Harsh training methods are unnecessary, as Golden
            Retrievers often respond very well to positive and upbeat training styles.</p>
          <p>Golden Retrievers are compatible with other dogs, cats, and most livestock. They are particularly valued
            for their high level of sociability towards people, calmness, and willingness to learn. Because of this,
            they are commonly used as guide dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and search and rescue dogs. .</p>

          <p>The average lifespan for a Golden Retriever is about 11 to 12 years. The breed is susceptible to specific
            ailments, so pets should be taken to a veterinarian for yearly checkups. <br>
            <center> <img src="../ges (5).jpeg" style="width:50%" "height=70%"></center>
            Golden Retrievers are known to have genetic disorders and other diseases. Hip dysplasia is common in the
            breed; when buying a puppy, the pedigree should be known and be examined by the OFA or by PennHIP for hip
            disease. Obesity is also common in the breed because Golden Retrievers love to eat. Puppies should eat about
            three cups of food a day and adults three to five cups, depending on the food and how active the dog is .

          <p>Cancer is the breed's biggest killer, causing 61.4% of American Golden deaths according to a 1998 health
            study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America. The most common is hemangiosarcoma, followed by
            lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma. A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at
            38.8%.Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip
            and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs.Eye diseases are also possible in the breed; cataracts are the
            most common eye disease,but they can also be afflicted with progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma,
            distichiasis, entropion. corneal dystrophy, and retinal dysplasia.</p>
          <img src="../ges (8).jpeg" style="width:30%" "height=30%" align="right">
          <p>They may suffer from heart disease, especially subvalvular aortic stenosis,and cardiomyopathy and joint
            diseases, including patella luxation, osteochondritis, panosteitis, and cruciate ligament rupture. Their
            long hair also gets knotted up under the ears and longer hairs on their belly and legs if not groomed, these
            dreads can be cut out with scissors with slow rapid cuts. They can cause pain and discomfort and if left too
            long will get more matted. In addition to the heavy shedding they experience (and their constant lighter
            shedding throughout the year), Golden Retrievers can suffer from skin diseases; the most prevalent skin
            problem is allergies (often leading to acute moist dermatitis or "hot spots"), with the most common allergy
            being to fleas. They can also suffer from seborrhoea, sebaceous adenitis, self-inflicted lick granuloma, and
            haemophilia.</p>

          <p>Golden Retrievers require regular grooming and occasional baths. Their coats shed somewhat during the year,
            but are known to shed profusely twice a year. They also need to have their ears cleaned regularly, or ear
            infections might occur. While shedding is unavoidable, frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the
            amount of hair shed by the animal. Severe shedding resulting in bald patches can be indicative of stress or
            sickness.</p>

          <p>The Golden Retriever's eagerness to please has made it a consistent, top performer in the obedience and
            agility rings. Its excellent swimming ability makes it proficient at dock jumping. A natural retrieving
            ability means it is also competitive in flyball and field trials.</p>

          <p>The first three dogs ever to achieve the AKC Obedience Champion title were Golden Retrievers; the first of
            the three was a female named 'Ch. Moreland's Golden Tonka'.

            Since Golden Retrievers are so trainable, they are used for many important jobs, such as guide dogs for
            blind people, drug or bomb sniffing at airports, or helping to rescuing people from earthquakes and other
            natural disasters.This breed is also used in water rescue/lifesaving, along with the Leonberger,
            Newfoundland and Labrador Retriever dogs.</p>

          <p>The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.At that time, wildfowl hunting
            was a popular sport for the wealthy Scottish elite, but the existing retriever breeds were inadequate for
            retrieving downed game from both water and land. Retrieving from both land and water was necessary because
            the hunting grounds of the time were pocketed with marshy ponds and rivers. Consequently, the best water
            spaniels were crossed with the existing retrievers, resulting in the establishment of the breed today known
            as the Golden Retriever.The Golden Retriever was first developed near Glen Affric in Scotland, at
            "Guisachan", the highland estate of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth.The breed is thought to have
            originated from the now-extinct Russian tracker dog.</p>
          <p>Improvements in guns during the 1800s resulted in more fowl being downed during hunts at greater distances
            and over increasingly difficult terrain, leading to more birds being lost in the field. Because of this
            improvement in firearms, a need for a specialist retriever arose, as training setter and pointer breeds in
            retrievals was found to be ineffective. Thus, work began on the breeding of the dog to fill this much-needed
            role.</p>
          <p>The original cross was of a yellow-coloured retriever, 'Nous', with a Tweed Water Spaniel female dog,
            'Belle'. The Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct, but was then common in the border country. <br>Marjoribanks
            had purchased Nous in 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated retriever pups. In
            1868, this cross produced a litter that included four pups; these four became the basis of a breeding
            program which included the Irish Setter, the sandy-coloured Bloodhound, the St. John's water dog of
            Newfoundland, and two more wavy-coated black retrievers. The bloodline was also inbred and selected for
            trueness to Marjoribanks' idea of the ultimate hunting dog. His vision included a more vigorous and powerful
            dog than previous retrievers, one that would still be gentle and trainable. Russian sheepdogs are not
            mentioned in these records, nor are any other working dog breeds. The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is
            all sporting dogs, in line with Marjoribanks' goals. The Golden Retriever was active and powerful and had a
            gentle mouth for retrieving games while on hunts.[full citation needed]<br>

            Organisations other than clubs are dedicated to Golden Retrievers, such as breed-specific adoption sites.
            One such organisation is the Golden Retriever Club of Scotland, which in August 2013 assembled 222 Golden
            Retrievers at the historical home of the first Golden Retrievers.

          <h4>In the United Kingdom</h4>
          <p>A Golden retriever puppy at play
            Golden Retrievers were first accepted for registration by The Kennel Club in 1903, as Flat Coats – Golden.
            They were first exhibited in 1908, and in 1911 were recognized as a breed referred to as Retriever (Golden
            and Yellow). </p>
          <h4>In Scotland</h4>
          <p>In July 2006, the Golden Retriever Club of Scotland organized a gathering of Golden Retriever enthusiasts
            at the ancestral home, Guisachan House. A photograph taken by photographer Lynn Kipps to commemorate the
            occasion captured 188 Golden Retrievers, and so holds the record for the most Golden Retrievers in one
            image.</p>
          <h4>In the United States</h4>
          <p>It took another 14 years for the breed to be recognized in America, and in 1925, the American Kennel Club
            did so. In 1938, the Golden Retriever Club of America was founded. Golden Retrievers are ranked number two
            for American Kennel Club Registrations. As of the year 1999, 62,652 have been registered and the only breed
            above them is the Labrador Retriever. According to the purebred dog guide recognized by the American Kennel
            Club, Golden Retrievers are judged based on a variety of traits: colour, coat, ears, feet, nose, body, etc.
          </p>
          <h4>In Canada</h4>
          <p>The Honourable Archie Marjoribanks took a Golden Retriever to Canada in 1881, and registered 'Lady' with
            the AKC in 1894. These are the first records of the breed in these two countries. The breed was first
            registered in Canada in 1927, and the Golden Retriever Club of Ontario (GRCO) was formed in 1958. The
            cofounders of the GRCO were Cliff Drysdale, an Englishman who had brought over an English Golden, and Jutta
            Baker, daughter-in-law of Louis Baker, who owned Northland Kennels. The GCRO in later years expanded to
            become the Golden Retriever Club of Canada. </p>
          <h3>Notable dogs</h3>
          <p>Liberty, the presidential pet of President Gerald R. Ford, and Victory, the presidential pet of Ronald
            Reagan,were Golden Retrievers. The breed has also featured in a number of films and TV series, including the
            Air Bud film series, Full House, Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey and Homeward Bound II: Lost in San
            Francisco, Fluke, Napoleon, Up, Pushing Daisies, You've Got Mail, The Drew Carey Show, and Cats & Dogs. Cash
            from The Fox and the Hound 2 was also a mix of this breed, as was Whopper from Pound Puppies.</p>
          <p>A female Golden Retriever named Goldie appeared on the UK BBC One children's programme Blue Peter from 1978
            to 1986. Monty Don, a presenter of the UK BBC Two gardening programme Gardeners' World has a male Golden
            Retriever called Nigel who appears with him most of the time on the programme.A Golden Retriever portrayed
            the role of Levi, the hearing dog of the titular deaf FBI agent in Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye, based on the life of
            the real Sue Thomas.</p>
          <p>Orca, awarded the PDSA Gold Medal for animal bravery</p>
          <p>
            Kira (2019), a female English Golden Retriever that became a hero and an instant global sensation, when on
            her own accord she twice assisted her owner in breaking through ice and rescuing two dogs separately
            stranded in a frozen lake, rounding up each animal and guiding them safely to shore. The video of the rescue
            went viral and gained over 100 million views in just under one week.</p>
