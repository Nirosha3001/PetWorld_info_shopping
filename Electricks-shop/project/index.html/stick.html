  <p><b>Stick Insects</b> The stick insect has been entertaining and educating school-age children in classrooms
    for years, because of its unique appearance and simple care needs. Now, more and more people are keeping
    stick insects as pets at home, according to science author Sandra Markle. These intriguing insects are
    usually
    around 3 to 4 inches (7 to 10 centimeters) long and can live for several years in the right conditions..</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>10 Fascinating Facts About Stick Insects
</b></button>

<div class="content">
  <center>  <img src="../Sts (5).jpeg" style="width:50%" "height=70%"></center>
 
  


    <p >Stick insects are part of the order Phasmatodea 
    (also known as phasmids and walking sticks) and are most often found in subtropical tropical habitats—when you can find them, that is. These amazing bugs are hard to spot because they look 
    so much like twigs—until those twigs get up and walk away, that is.<br/><br/>

    1. <b>Stick Insects Can Regenerate Limbs</b>
    Should a bird or other predator grab hold of its leg, a stick insect can still make an easy escape. Using a special muscle to break it off at a weak joint, the imperiled insect simply sheds the leg in a defensive strategy is known as autotomy. Juvenile stick insects regenerate the missing limb the next time they molt. In some cases, adult stick 
    insects can even force themselves to molt in order to regain a lost leg.
   <br/>
    2. <b>Stick Insects Can Reproduce Without Males</b>
    Stick insects are a nation of Amazonians, able to reproduce almost entirely without males, 
    using a process known as parthenogenesis. Unmated females produce eggs that when mature, 
    become female stick insects. When a male does manage to mate with a female, 
    there's only a 50/50 chance that the offspring of that union will be male. A captive female stick insect can produce hundreds of all-female offspring without ever mating. 
    In fact, there are species of stick insects for which scientists have never found any males.<br/>
    3. <b>Stick Insects Even Act Like Sticks</b>
    Stick insects are so named for their effective camouflage among the woody plants where they feed. They're typically brown, black, or green, with thin, stick-shaped bodies that help them blend in as they perch on twigs and branches. Some stick insects exhibit lichen-like markings to make their camouflage more authentic but to make the disguise complete, stick insects imitate twigs swaying in the wind by rocking back and forth as they move.
    
    <br/>
    <img src="../Sts (3).jpeg" style="width:30%" "height=45%" align="left">
    4. <b>Their Eggs Resemble Seeds</b>
    Stick insect mothers aren't the most maternal. While some stick insects females actually make an effort to hide their eggs—sticking them to leaves or bark or placing them in the soil—they typically drop eggs randomly on the forest floor, leaving the youngsters to whatever fate befalls them. Don't be so quick to judge mama stick insect, though. By spreading her eggs out, she lessens the chance of predators finding and eating all of her offspring at once. It's also helpful that the eggs resemble seeds, so carnivorous predators are less likely to take a closer look.
    <br/>
    5. <b>Nymphs Eat Their Molted Skin</b>
    
    After a nymph has molted, it's vulnerable to predators until its new cuticle darkens and hardens. The castoff skin nearby is a dead giveaway to enemies so the nymph quickly consumes the shriveled exoskeleton to get rid of the evidence, simultaneously recycling the protein it took to create the discarded layer at the same time.
    <br/>6. <b>Stick Insects Aren't Defenseless</b>
Stick insects aren't venomous but if threatened, one will use whatever means necessary to thwart its attacker. Some will regurgitate a nasty substance to put a bad taste in a hungry predator's mouth. Others reflex bleed, oozing a foul-smelling hemolymph from joints in their body. Some of the large, tropical stick insects may use their leg spines, which help them climb, to inflict some pain on an enemy. Stick insects may even direct a chemical spray, much like tear gas, at the offender.
<br/>
7. <b>Their Eggs May Attract Ants</b>
Stick insect eggs that resemble hard seeds have a special, fatty capsule called a capitulum at one end. Ants enjoy the nutritional boost provided by the capitulum and carry the stick insect eggs back to their nests for a meal. After the ants feed on the fats and nutrients, they toss the eggs onto their garbage heap, where the eggs continue to incubate, safe from predators. As the nymphs hatch, they make their way out of the ant nest.
<br/>
8. <b>Not All Stick Insects Stay Brown</b>
Some stick insects can change color, like a chameleon, depending on the background where they're at rest. Stick insects may also wear bright colors on their wings but keep these flamboyant features tucked away. When a bird or other predator approaches, the stick insect flashes its vibrant wings, then hides them again, leaving the predator confused and unable to relocate its target.
<br/>
9. <b>Stick Insects Can Play Dead</b>
When all else fails, play dead, right? A threatened stick insect will abruptly drop from wherever it's perched, fall to the ground, and stay very still. This behavior, called thanatosis, can successfully discourage predators. A bird or mouse may be unable to find the immobile insect on the ground or prefer living prey and move on.
<br/>
10. <b>Stick Insects Are the World's Longest</b>
In 2008, a newly discovered stick insect species from Borneo broke the record for longest insect (which had previously been held by another stick insect, Pharnacia serratipes). The Chan's Megastick, Phobaeticus chani, measures an incredible 22 inches with legs extended, with a body length of 14 inches.

<div class="content">
 


  <p>Stick insects tend to be quite tame so will sit on your hand, but caution must be taken when picking them up or handling them. Very carefully grasp them by the body (not the legs!) between your thumb and forefinger and place them on your open palm, or simply offer your open palm and gently nudge them onto your hand. They do not require daily maintenance and can be left for up to a week without any care. Stick insects are naturally nocturnal.
     They are most active at night. During the day they are usually inactive and still unless they are disturbed.

<div class="content">
 
  <img src="../IMG-20200318-WA0017.jpg" style="width:30%" "height=40%" align="right">

  <p>As a rule, stick insects need an enclosure that is three times as tall as the length of the insect. For Indian stick insects, this means a cage a minimum of 12 inches tall, although a little taller would be better. Glass aquaria (10 to 15 gallon), tall glass jars, plastic pet containers, and other similar containers work well for housing, but the lid needs to be well-ventilated and secure to prevent escapes. Fine netting can be fixed over the opening to such containers.


    Indian stick insects should be kept fairly warm, around 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius). The temperature can be allowed to decrease a bit at night to mid to high 60s F. The best way to achieve the proper temperature is to keep them in a warm room, although supplementary heat can be provided through head pads meant for reptile enclosures or by placing a lamp near the cage. Using lamps for heat can be very drying and white bulbs should not be used at night (red or blue colored bulbs can be used).
    
    <img src="../IMG-20200318-WA0018.jpg" style="width:30%" "height=40%" align="left">
    If using potted plants in the vivarium, consider using a fluorescent fixture above the vivarium for optimal plant growth. Stick insects need a moderate level of humidity, but the vivarium should be well ventilated to prevent mold growth. Misting the leaves of the plant will provide water for the insects to drink and help maintain humidity levels.
    
    The floor of the tank can be covered with paper for easy cleanup. An alternative material that helps conserve humidity is peat moss or vermiculite. This takes a bit more effort to keep clean, and shouldn't be kept too moist since mold growth could be a problem. Stick insects produce a fairly dry waste which is easy to clean up.

<div class="content">
 
<center><img src="../IMG-20200318-WA0019.jpg" style="width:30%" "height=40%" align="right"></center>

  <p>Bramble (blackberry) is generally considered an appropriate diet for many stick insects. Other options include raspberry, privet, hawthorn, oak, rose, and ivy. Fresh cut branches of these plants can be placed in water in the cage and changed once they dry out (or are consumed). The water container must be closed off or sealed so that the insects do not fall into the water and drown (choose a narrow-necked jar and place some material around the plant stems to seal off the opening). An alternative to feeding cut branches is to grow small potted plants of the desired species and place them in the cage. They can also eat lettuce, which should be washed and cleaned well.

    The most important thing to consider is that any food must be free of insecticides and herbicides or it may be lethal to your pets. Care must be taken when collecting food to make sure it hasn't been exposed to these materials. Try to avoid collecting food near busy roadways. Even if using potted plants, make sure that the soil used is free of pesticides, as some soils are infused with pesticides which may make their way into plants grown in the soil.

  <p>There are no major health problems that impact stick insects. They do hang upside down to shed their skin and require a large vertical space to shed. 
    If the space they have is limited, the stick insect will die or become severely deformed.

  <p>If you are in the United States or Canada, tropical species such 
    as the Indian Walking sticks are considered plant pests. A permit (United States Department of Agriculture or Canadian Food Inspection Agency) is required to import them. In other areas, check with the appropriate government agency about legality (e.g. a Department of Agriculture or similar agency).

    Non-native stick insects should never be released into the wild 
    due to the risk that they could reproduce and cause damage to an 
    ecosystem where they are not normally found; non-native species are considered plant pests. This includes making sure any eggs are disposed of by crushing, boiling, or burning, as no special care is needed for many species' eggs to hatch.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Reproduction</b></button>

<div class="content">
 
<center><img src="../Sts (6).jpeg" style="width:30%" "height=40%" align="right"></center>

  <p>Indian stick insects can reproduce in the absence of a male (parthenogenetic reproduction). A female will lay hundreds of tiny eggs (0.08 inches) over her life. These are smooth and round​ and can be collected from the bottom of the cage if desired. Place them in a tub of sand or vermiculite and leave in a warm place. They may take up to a year to hatch, and they should be kept in small separate rearing containers until they reach adulthood when they can be housed in small groups (similar environment to adults, feed a fresh supply of leaves often).

    The babies ("nymphs") molt several times before reaching adulthood, and during this process, they will hang suspended from a branch or the lid of the container. Molting is an extremely vulnerable time in development, and the insects should be left alone and not handled until the new exoskeleton is hardened after a molt.

  <p>Stick insects are very low-maintenance and
    generally make good first pets for children, as long as adults are in charge of cleaning and
    handling duties. Special care should be taken when handling the insects, as their limbs can break
    easily.
    The species' unique appearance and
    interesting molting process make them a living science project for anyone's home.

    <p class="bla1">Stick insects need tall enclosures, at least double the height of the insect,
        because they like to hang. They are omnivores and thrive on a diet of bramble, ivy or even lettuce.
        These insects don't like being alone and need other stick insects for companionship.
        Their enclosures should be kept at room temperature and cleaned out weekly.
        Stick insects molt many times before they reach maturity and need
        enough room to literally climb out of their skin.
